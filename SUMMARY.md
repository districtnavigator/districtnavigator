### 🎮 Core Features

#### 1. Random Road Selection
- Uses Google Places API nearbySearch
- Filters for actual roads (street, road, avenue, highway, etc.)
- Fallback to predefined list of 13 common Berea roads
- Geocoding for fallback roads

#### 2. Interactive Map
- Centered on Berea, SC (34.8854°N, 82.4568°W)
- Click to place guess marker (blue)
- Displays actual road location marker (red)
- Draws connecting line between markers
- Auto-zoom to show both locations

#### 3. Distance Calculation
- Uses spherical geometry for accurate distance
- Displays in miles or feet depending on distance
- Real-time calculation on submission

#### 4. User Feedback
- 5 levels of accuracy feedback with emojis:
  - 🎯 Amazing (< 100m)
  - 🎉 Great (< 500m)
  - 👍 Good (< 1000m)
  - 😊 Decent (< 2000m)
  - 🤔 Try Again (> 2000m)

#### 5. Game Controls
- "Submit Guess" button (enabled after placing pin)
- "New Road" button (always available)
- Automatic state management

### 🎨 Design Features

#### Visual Design
- Modern gradient header (purple theme)
- Clean, professional interface
- Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- High contrast for readability

#### User Experience
- Clear instructions
- Intuitive interaction
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Accessibility considerations

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with grid and flexbox
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic and API integration
- **Google Maps JavaScript API**: Map rendering
- **Google Places API**: Road discovery
- **Google Geocoding API**: Address to coordinates
- **Google Geometry API**: Distance calculations

#### Key Functions
- `initMap()`: Initialize map and event listeners
- `selectNewRoad()`: Fetch random road from API
- `useFallbackRoad()`: Fallback to predefined roads
- `placeUserGuess()`: Handle user click on map
- `submitGuess()`: Calculate and display results
- `displayResults()`: Format and show feedback
- `resetGame()`: Clear state for new round

#### State Management
- `map`: Google Maps instance
- `currentRoad`: Currently selected road object
- `userMarker`: User's guess marker
- `roadMarker`: Actual location marker
- `userGuessLocation`: Coordinates of user's guess

### 🔒 Security

#### Measures Implemented
- ✅ CodeQL security scan passed (0 vulnerabilities)
- ✅ .gitignore to prevent API key commits
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Input validation on user interactions
- ✅ Secure API usage patterns

#### Recommendations for Production
- Restrict API key to specific domains
- Enable HTTPS only
- Set up API usage quotas
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Implement rate limiting

### 📊 Testing

#### Completed
- ✅ JavaScript syntax validation
- ✅ CodeQL security scan
- ✅ Manual code review
- ✅ Logic verification

#### User Testing Required
- ⏳ Browser compatibility testing
- ⏳ Responsive design testing
- ⏳ API integration testing (requires API key)
- ⏳ User experience testing
- ⏳ Performance testing

See TESTING.md for complete testing checklist.

   - Use GitHub Pages, or
   - Run local server: `python -m http.server 8000`

4. **Test**
   - Open in browser
   - Verify map loads
   - Play a round
   - Check distance calculations

See SETUP.md for detailed instructions.

### 🎯 Success Criteria
